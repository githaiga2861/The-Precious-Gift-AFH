This is a ready-to-deploy Adult Family Home management system.
The Supabase project URL and anon key are already injected into `index.html`.
**No build step is required.** Push and deploy.

## Deploy on Vercel (recommended — fastest, free)

1. Push this folder to a new GitHub repository.
2. Go to **vercel.com → New Project → Import** your repository.
3. Vercel auto-detects a static site. Click **Deploy** — no settings to change.
   (`vercel.json` is already included and handles all routing.)
4. Your app is live at `https://your-repo-name.vercel.app` in about 30 seconds.

## Deploy on GitHub Pages (alternative)

1. Push this folder to a new GitHub repository.
2. **Settings → Pages → Source: Deploy from branch `main` → root `/` → Save.**
3. Your app will be live at `https://username.github.io/repo-name` in ~1 minute.

## Supabase setup (required for both deploy options)

1. Open your Supabase project at **supabase.com**.
2. **SQL Editor → New query** → paste and run the CareDesk Home schema
   (copy from CareDesk Pro → Settings → Client schemas → CareDesk AFH Home).
3. The admin login credentials are already baked in from your onboarding answers.
4. Sign in at your deployment URL and verify all modules load.

## After deployment

5. Set up the Lemon Squeezy subscription for this client.
6. Update the **System URL** in the CareDesk Pro Client CRM.
